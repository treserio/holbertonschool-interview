'''
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls
with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map,
calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

Prototype: def rain(walls)
walls is a list of non-negative integers.
Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.
Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1])
are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.
If the list is empty return 0.
